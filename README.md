# StellStruc
 StellStruc was my final project for my Stellar Structure class during my Master's program at UHCL. 
 This I would consider "beta" because right now, it cannot handle stars M > ~ 8 M_Sun. You also have to hand tweak
 some of th parameters if you want to see the solution for stars of other sizes and compositions. I will mark that 
 as 'forthcoming'.
